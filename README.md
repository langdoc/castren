In IKDP research project, funded by Kone Foundation between 2014-2016, some Komi texts collected by M.A. Castr√©n were digitalized and incorporated into spoken Komi corpus. Being written down in 1844, those are, as far as we can tell, the oldest representations of spoken Komi.

In the follow-up project, IKDP-2, focus is more in technical implementations and research use than in collecting new data, and some attempt is made to turn the digital materials edited now into a proper digital facsimile.
